# 02-Dynamic-Portfolio

This project went much better than the first one and was also fun to do. I did the majority of the project a weekend before it was due then tweaked a few things throughout the week.

I applied lessons learned in class and activites whiel creating this project.

The first thing that I did that I think really helped was that I started by writing all of my HTML first before assigning and CSS to the document. This helped me get a structure and while I was writing the HTML, I was _thinking_ about how I would use the CSS but not yet applying it.

Then I applied the CSS using Bootstrap. That got me in a pretty good place but there were definitely changes I had to make to the normal Bootstrap styles to match the assignment's styling. So I created my own stylesheet, then did overrides for bootstrap styling.

## Media Friendly Site

Part of the assignment was using media queries to change the way certain items looked on specified screen sizes. At the bottom of my stylesheet, I put in specific queries to accomplish different styling for the different device sizes.

## Custom Header Navigation

This was a component that I found more challening. The majority of my time spent researching/reading/watching videos was to learn how to control where and how items appear. I learned about flex boxes and how I can change things there.

## Cards

I _really_ liked working with the cards on the portfolio. This is such a useful tool, espcially when creating marketing websites. I'm excited to master this functionality.

## CSS Summary

After a couple weeks learning about CSS and Bootstrap, I really enjoy it. It certainly helps that I had previous knowledge working with CSS, and I already knew about the concept of Bootstrap though I never implemented it. I enjoy the challenges of putting the puzzle together to get a custom look for the different view ports.
